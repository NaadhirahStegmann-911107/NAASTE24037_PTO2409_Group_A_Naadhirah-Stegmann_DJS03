# Book Connect Refactoring Report

## Introduction
The "Book Connect" project is a web application for browsing books. This report discsusses the reefactoring process to improve maintainability, extendibility, and readability using abstraction.

## Refactoring Rationale
- **Objects**: Created `Book`, `BookListManager`, `DropdownManager`, and `ThemeManager` classes to encapsulate data and behavior.
- **Functions**: Modularized tasks like rendering (`renderBooks`) and filtering (`matchesFilters`) into reusable methods.
- **HTML**: Enhanced accessibility with ARIA attributes and semantic elements.
- **Performance**: Used lazy instantiation and DOM caching to handle large datasets.

## Benefits of Attraction
-**Maintainability**: Changes (e.g., updating preview layout) only require modifiying specific methods.
**Extendability**: Adding features (e.g., sorting) is easier with modular classes.
-**Readability**: Clear classes structure and JSDocs comments improve understanding.

## Challenges
- Ensuring performance with a large dataset required lazy instantiation and DOM caching.
- Breakingdown large event listeners into modular methods needed careeful data flow management.
- **Solution**: Tested incrementally and used classes to organize logic.

## Reflection
- Learned object-oriented programming in JavaScript (encapsulation, modularity).
- Gained experience with JSDocs and accessibility best practices.
- Understood the importance of performance optimization for large datasets.

## Conclusion
Refactoring "Book Connect" improved its code quality and prepared it for future enhancements, demonstrating the value of abstraction in real-world application.
